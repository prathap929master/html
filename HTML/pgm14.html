    <p>This is the first paragraph that appears above the paragraph with the 
    image!</p>
    <p><img src="E:\Salim\Internet & Web Technology\HTML\Code\Tulips.jpg" 
    width="75" height="75" alt="HTML Tutorial" align="right">
    The image will appear along the right hand side of the paragraph. As you can see 
    this is very nice for adding a little eye candy that relates to the specified 
    paragraph.</p>
    <p>The left and right image-alignment values tell the browser to place an image 
    against the left or right margin, respectively, of the current text flow. The browser 
    then renders subsequent document content in the remaining portion of the flow 
    adjacent to the image. The net result is that the document content following the 
    image gets wrapped around the image. </p>
